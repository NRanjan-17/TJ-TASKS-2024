A dancing river
Swirls under skies of gold light
Whispers echo loud

markdown
Copy code

- **Bonus:** Fancy formatting or unexpected poetry theme (5 points)

---

## 🚀 **Level 1: Easy**
### **Task: Text Generator Using Markov Chains**
**Description:** Build a **simple text generator** using Markov Chains. Use a text corpus of your choice (Shakespeare’s plays, song lyrics, etc.) and generate short but coherent sentences.

**Deliverables:**
1. Markov Chain model implementation
2. 5 samples of generated sentences
3. Short explanation of how Markov Chains were used

**Grading Parameters:**
- **Correctness:** (10 points)
- **Completeness:** (5 points)
- **Creativity of Text Outputs:** (5 points)

---

## 🌱 **Level 2: Intermediate**
### **Task: AI Image Caption Generator**
**Description:** Create a pipeline that takes an **image** as input and generates a **caption** for it using a pre-trained model (e.g., InceptionNet + LSTM). Try using **MS COCO samples** or your own image collection.

**Deliverables:**
1. Image captioning model pipeline
2. Captions for at least **3 images**
3. Short write-up about how your model works

**Grading Parameters:**
- **Accuracy of Captions:** (15 points)
- **Technical Pipeline:** (10 points)
- **Creativity & Error Handling:** (5 points)

---

## 🔥 **Level 3: Advanced**
### **Task: Fine-tune a Language Model (Choice-based)**
**Description:** Choose a small GPT model (or BERT variant) and **fine-tune** it on a niche dataset of your choice (e.g., movie dialogues, poetry, or even cooking recipes!). The goal is to make the model generate contextually relevant responses.

**Deliverables:**
1. Fine-tuned model (via GitHub or Colab)
2. Model performance metrics (e.g., BLEU, Perplexity)
3. Sample outputs with **explanation of limitations**

**Grading Parameters:**
- **Performance:** (20 points)
- **Explanation of Results & Challenges:** (10 points)
- **Creativity of Dataset/Theme:** (5 points)

---

## 🏅 **Bonus Challenge: Generative Artwork**
**Description:** Use **Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, or VQGAN + CLIP** to create digital artwork around a theme of your choice (e.g., “The Future of AI,” “Dreamscapes,” etc.). Include a **short description** explaining your inspiration. 🎨

**Deliverables:**
1. At least **2 artworks**
2. Concept description (100-150 words)
3. Technical process overview

**Grading Parameters:**
- **Visual Appeal & Theme Relevance:** (20 points)
- **Technical Documentation:** (10 points)
- **Creative Explanation:** (10 points)
