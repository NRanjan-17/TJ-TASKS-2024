# TASKS:

There are 3 tasks divided into 3 categories according to their difficulty levels.

Note : The YouTube video links are provided only for reference. Do not create an exact copy of the referenced websites.

## Easy:

**Build a responsive card component layout using CSS Grid.**
- **Requirements**:
  - Create an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`styles.css`).
  - The card should include:
    - An image (use a placeholder image if necessary)
    - A title (e.g., "Card Title")
    - A description (a brief text about the card content)
    - A button (e.g., "Learn More")
  - Use CSS Grid to arrange the elements and ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.

## Medium:

**Build a translation tool that can accurately translate text between different languages**

- **Requirements**:
  - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the tool.
  - The translation tool should include:
    - An input field for users to enter text.
    - A dropdown menu for selecting the target language.
    - A button to submit the translation request.
    - A display area to show the translated text.
  - Integrate a public translation API (e.g., Google Translate API) to fetch translations.

## Hard:

**Develop a secure user authentication system, utilizing JWT tokens and session expiration.**
- **Requirements**:
  - **JWT Authentication**: Use JWT tokens to secure user sessions. When a user logs in, generate a token, and store it securely on the client-side (e.g., using cookies or local storage).
- **User Authentication**: 
  - **Sign-Up**: Allow users to create an account with a username/email and password.
  - **Sign-In**: Implement login functionality to authenticate users.
  - Protect sensitive routes (such as the dashboard) so that they are only accessible to authenticated users.
- **Session Expiration**: Implement session expiration using the JWT token's expiry feature.
