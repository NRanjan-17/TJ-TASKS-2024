# ü•≥ **Project Levels and Tasks**

---

## üåü **Beginner Level (Super Easy)**
### **Task: Random Poetry Generator**
**Description:** Write a script that randomly selects words from a list (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) and generates a short **poem** or **haiku**. Add a bit of formatting magic to make it look fancy! üé©

**Quick Learning:**
- [Python Random Module Tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-random/)
- [JavaScript Random Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp)

**Example Output:**
```
A dancing river
Swirls under skies of gold light
Whispers echo loud
```

**Deliverables:**
1. Python/JavaScript code generating at least **5 unique poems**
2. Include formatting touches for creativity points
3. Submit code on GitHub

---

## üöÄ **Level 1: Easy**
### **Task: Text Generator Using Markov Chains**
**Description:** Build a **simple text generator** using Markov Chains. Use a text corpus of your choice (Shakespeare's plays, song lyrics, etc.) and generate short but coherent sentences.

**Quick Learning:**
- [Markov Chains Explained](https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/)
- [Implementing Markov Chain in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/text-generation-using-markov-chains-in-python/)

**Deliverables:**
1. Markov Chain model implementation
2. 5 samples of generated sentences
3. Short explanation of how Markov Chains were used

---

## üå± **Level 2: Intermediate**
### **Task: AI Image Caption Generator**
**Description:** Create a pipeline that takes an **image** as input and generates a **caption** for it using a pre-trained model (e.g., InceptionNet + LSTM). Try using **MS COCO samples** or your own image collection.

**Quick Learning:**
- [Image Captioning with Keras Tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/)
- [Hugging Face Image Captioning](https://huggingface.co/spaces/keras-io/image-captioning)

**Deliverables:**
1. Image captioning model pipeline
2. Captions for at least **3 images**
3. Short write-up about how your model works

---

## üî• **Level 3: Advanced**
### **Task: Fine-tune a Language Model (Choice-based)**
**Description:** Choose a small GPT model (or BERT variant) and **fine-tune** it on a niche dataset of your choice (e.g., movie dialogues, poetry, or even cooking recipes!). The goal is to make the model generate contextually relevant responses.

**Quick Learning:**
- [Fine-tuning GPT-2 Tutorial](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate)
- [Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/fine_tune_bert)

**Deliverables:**
1. Fine-tuned model (via GitHub or Colab)
2. Model performance metrics (e.g., BLEU, Perplexity)
3. Sample outputs with **explanation of limitations**

---

## üèÖ **Bonus Challenge: Generative Artwork**
**Description:** Use **Stable Diffusion, DALL¬∑E, or VQGAN + CLIP** to create digital artwork around a theme of your choice (e.g., "The Future of AI," "Dreamscapes," etc.). Include a **short description** explaining your inspiration. üé®

**Quick Learning:**
- [Getting Started with Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release)
- [VQGAN+CLIP Tutorial](https://sourceful.us/doc/935/introduction-to-vqganclip)

**Deliverables:**
