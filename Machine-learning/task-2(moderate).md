## Moderate Level - Scikit Learn models

### Question:
Build a custom regression model that predicts the number of active users on a streaming platform using weather conditions as input features.

#### Steps for Attempting the Question:

1. Dataset Preparation: Collect or use a dataset containing weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) and the number of active users on a streaming platform.
2. Data Preprocessing: 
* Handle missing values.
* Normalize or standardize numerical features.
* Perform feature engineering, such as encoding categorical features like weather types (sunny, rainy, etc.).
3. Model Selection: Choose a regression model from scikit-learn (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, or Decision Tree Regressor).
4. Train/Test Split: Split the dataset into training and test sets.
5. Model Training: Train the model on the training set using appropriate evaluation metrics like RMSE or MAE.
6. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.
7. Evaluation: Evaluate the model on the test set and visualize the predicted vs actual user counts using a line plot or scatter plot.
